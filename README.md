This is the code repository for [Tkinter GUI Application Development Blueprints - Second Edition][LinkToBook], published by [Packt][LinkToProducer]. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the Book

Tkinter is the built-in GUI package that comes with standard Python distributions. It is a cross-platform package, which means you build once and deploy everywhere. It is simple to use and intuitive in nature, making it suitable for programmers and non-programmers alike.

This book will help you master the art of GUI programming. It delivers the bigger picture of GUI programming by building real-world, productive, and fun applications such as a text editor, drum machine, game of chess, audio player, drawing application, piano tutor, chat application, screen saver, port scanner, and much more. In every project, you will build on the skills acquired in the previous project and gain more expertise. You will learn to write multithreaded programs, network programs, database-driven programs, asyncio based programming and more. You will also get to know the modern best practices involved in writing GUI apps.

## Instructions and Navigation

All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

All chapters have code files placed in their respective folder.

The code will look like the following:

```python
def toggle_play_button_state(self):
  if self.now_playing:
    self.play_button.config(state="disabled")
  else:
    self.play_button.config(state="normal")
```

We assume an introductory level familiarity with the basic constructs of Python programming language. We use Python version 3.6 with Tkinter 8.6, and it is recommended to stick to these exact versions to avoid compatibility issues. The programs discussed in this book have been developed on the Linux Mint platform. However, given the multiplatform abilities of Tkinter, you can easily work along on other platforms such as Windows, Mac OS, and other distributions of Linux. The links to download and install other project-specific modules and software are mentioned in the respective chapters.
